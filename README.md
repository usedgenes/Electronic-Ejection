# Electronic-Ejection
Purpose: A project to use electronics to be able to choose what altitude a rocket's parachute ejects

Background: Normal model rockets typically use black powder (gunpowder) to deploy a parachute, either using a delay charge or with an e-match connected to a MOSFET and flight computer. However, black powder is not always a good option due to the nature of it being an explosive, and so this project is designed to be an alternative to that. It uses a servo and 4 springs to push a parachute out.
